# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In application.py there is my server-side code.
In index.html there is the html structure of the website as well as the css styling in the <style> tags and the javascript logic in the <script> tags.
  
The personal touch I chose to complete was the ability to delete one's own messages.
